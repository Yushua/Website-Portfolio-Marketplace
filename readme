Project has a webpage where one cna create an account, login, and then go through the pages
I created for my protfolio

right now planned

- marketplace

here you can sell, buy and set items you want to buy.

there is a page for each of them, to simple showcase microservice functionality.
There is a page to also have a fake delivery service. so you get a notification
when it is done. the time it take is set by the seller.

- booking hotels

crate a website where I can set hotels, rooms, and reseve these rooms.

You cna look up hotels, or the specific rooms. by searching location and the preferences

right now its simple, its city, number of beds/large beds. Wifi, breakfast, parking. 

ther eis a sytem that keeps in check the date that one can fill in the hotel room. a simple project to showcase a wider aspect of a website.
